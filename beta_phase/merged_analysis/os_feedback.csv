0,100.1.197.247,Android,More information
31,67.82.145.227,Android,Use colors.
33,68.37.167.213,Android,"Maybe it's not phone friendly? & Not everyone has a printer. I didn't see where I could download anything. Type was small and I couldn't just enlarge it from my phone to read. (By taking my two fingers and pulling out on the screen. I'm one who had a full hysterectomy, no ovaries and took my cervix. I wish someone would have told me about how different sex was going to be. No warning. I was in my forties. I'm now in my fifties. The doctor was also a woman. "
68,99.32.58.89,Android,"Didn't see women's stories, more on treatment options"
36,70.170.52.38,Android,"Some of the charts didn't fit mobile screen, didn't find adjustment button until finished. Probably should be more noticeable."
37,70.175.75.192,Android,If you strongly disagree with natural herbs and remedies then put more details of the study on your website. It only says it was done. It doesn't say for how long. For all I know it was only 1 treatment and nothing works on 1 treatment. If the study isn't at least 3 or more months for a study with a natural remedy then it's not going to have accurate data.
39,71.12.154.101,Android,Hormone replacement therapy contraindications
40,71.192.14.0,Android,"I was looking for more in depth information 
This may be a good place for people to start "
41,71.214.48.85,Android,I liked all of it.
42,71.240.196.40,Android,"I might suggest changing ""symptoms"" to ""indicators"". The word symptom sounds like diagnosing a sickness or disease. Menopause is neither sickness nor disease."
44,71.81.210.174,Android,Great source of info. The menopause tool doesn't work the best with mobile so I'll have to look at it again on my computer. I am planning to visit my doctor soon so this helped me pinpoint some things to talk about. 
45,72.220.69.176,Android,Nothing Great
30,67.43.240.171,Android,"I noticed some of the links had trouble working. I was thrilled to see trans positive messages (like, ""gender affirming medication""). If possible, I think more information about healthy eating (more than a link to the gov website) and exercise ideas would be lovely."
46,73.182.217.127,Android,"I may have missed it, but I would like a tool to know if I'm in perimenopause"
48,73.254.223.191,Android,"I would love more information on pre- or perimenopause, not just about menopause. "
50,73.94.49.153,Android,I was interested in the prescription meds that help with symptoms because I am taking lexapro and gabapentin. I have experienced very few adverse reactions regarding menopause. That is the first I have heard of those meds helping.
54,75.48.121.67,Android,I haven't had a period in 18 years. I had a vaginal hysterectomy. I'm 62. I didn't take any hormones. I'm confused about when my symptoms will end. They seem to go up and down. I'd like to see that addressed. I'm sure I'm not the only one.  I loved the site. Will download if possible. Thank you for doing this. Like other female issues this was never spoke about in my family. 
55,75.58.42.195,Android,"Information on individual symptoms was thotough and informative. I really liked that you hive treatments that work, might work, and don't work. "
56,76.118.85.20,Android,I could not answer the survey because the site kept shutting down on me and would not refresh.  I would like to see your information and the menoplan!
57,76.234.140.218,Android,I know that I have developed bad acne. My doctor has contributed it to hormonal change and I just need to be patient and wait it out. If there are any ideas about what may help perimenopausal acne I think  it may help women also having the same issue especially when a recommended solution is hormones and I myself have health issues and can't do that. 
60,98.152.32.83,Android,If this website is offering the most current info on the subject then women are fucked.
62,98.174.82.34,Android,"I didn't actually see the ""am I in menopause"" tool the first time through. Or other women's stories  I'll have to go back and look again."
63,98.201.203.55,Android,"Loved the info, testimony and tools. Best site for menopausal women. Thank you!"
65,99.107.148.72,Android,I found your opinions on treatment options very disappointing especially it pertains to natural remedies.
66,99.185.57.102,Android,"I like the idea of the site but there were some issues. Both the FB ad and the site contained typos: ""sneak peak"" and ""bloods."" The link from the vaginal pain page back to the symptoms list did not work. I didn't understand the structure of the symptoms pages. E.g. they might list 5 treatment options then had a single Bottom Line--will it work section. I think the stories section would be better if the stories were edited to be more concise and if the pictures were better/higher resolution. My Menoplan returned a table of the 3 symptoms I had selected and one of the columns was tiny. This may have been an issue only on mobile phones. I do like the idea of a research-based site that isn't trying to sell anything and contains info curated by medical professionals."
47,73.248.196.67,Android,The website is extremely buggy. Every time I went to a different web page it would error out. Tried refreshing but would not work.  Had to go back to the social media site each time I wanted to go to a different section. All the tools were flagged as malicious so I could not use them.  I was using my cellphone to access it.
27,64.127.165.14,Android,"N/A, I thought it was a great site."
69,99.82.254.180,Android,Info on diet was presented well and straightforward. Consider adding info about meeting a diet Ian rather than just about free apps. I don't consider myself too computer savvy but the website was easy to use.
11,172.58.184.103,Android,"I have low sex drive hot flashes and dryness in the Virginia
"
26,50.122.27.199,Android,"I like the different areas to go to, based on the readers particular interests or questions and concerns. I think a bit more info should be available regarding perimenopause. The AM I IN MENOPAUSE tool indicated I'm not in menopause yet. Which I knew already & the tool simply helped reconfirm that. However, while my periods are still monthly, I am having quite a few symptoms associated with menopause. More information and/or direction would have made me feel better. "
12,172.58.23.222,Android,The menoplan did not work.  No recommended treatments populated.
2,107.242.113.5,Android,Information on vulva dryness and itching. Also something on bacteria vaginitis
14,172.58.44.251,Android,I really like the color. Please don't change the color.
15,172.79.21.112,Android,"I like the food info the best. More info on exercise, exactly what to do or links. Thats my mine issue now is mid section weight gain. "
5,108.238.90.79,Android,Mommameeya3@outlook.com
16,174.211.129.240,Android,More plans or treatments 
17,184.97.48.228,Android,I thought the chat with the list of symptoms and treat!wants was so!what confusing. It was interesting to find that symptoms I have been suffering from may be due to Perimenopause.
18,209.107.179.56,Android,"The making a menoplan tool was a little hard to read, at least on my phone. "
3,108.213.221.15,Android,"I will be 54 in a week. I had a uteran ablasion done about 4 years ago. I still have my uterus and both ovaries. My periods stopped because of the procedure. I wasn't sure how to categorize myself. Should I be in the periods have not occurred in a year category? Or surgery may have brought on symptoms? Unrelated, I am using my Android phone and was not able to download my treatment plan. I picked 6 symptoms and picked 3 treatment options. Clicked next. It took me to a blank page. Not sure if it was because I was on a phone or if there was a glitch in the system. I will try again tomorrow using my laptop.  "
19,209.107.180.22,Android,"I really hate the ""those that have periods"" thing. The vast, vast majority of people with periods identify as women. I'm sick of us being erased. Just call us who we are: women. "
20,24.0.99.105,Android,Nice to.have all info in one place rather than searching all over the internet not knowing who to trust. 
21,24.118.105.76,Android,It would be nice to have the hot flash tracker on the app vs having to print everything.  The menopause treatments were disappointing and it felt that everything  was geared towards medicine vs alternative solutions  to symptoms 
4,108.234.124.199,Android,"I love this website. It is unique. Although I was born F and ID as she I appreciate that you have included trans, non-binary women. I wish there was more info on help with dry eyes and skin. I have found on other sites better options such as use of loofas, omegas, evening primrose for dryness. I'm sure there are others. I would like to see this area expanded. Overall the website is excellent and use friendly. "
9,162.222.31.52,Android,"It was disappointing to learn that there is very little that works to treat most menopause symptoms. The website is likely helpful to someone at the premenopause stage, to learn what to expect... or a family member looking to understand. However, as a woman who's been dealing with menopause for awhile, I'm leaving with the message that I just need to find a way to cope with the significant symptoms, because there's nothing I can do to change it. That's depressing."
23,24.154.155.189,Android,"I think the 12-month time frame asking about periods is too big; I also feel like the IUD question is a little misleading because I have a copper IUD that never affected my periods, but I have had hormone testing and also am going into my 4ths month without a period. I've had the IUD for 8 or 9 years and have been regular the whole time. Also, if you are stating that chemotherapy for breast cancer can cause sudden menopause, you should also mention that menopause can end as well and periods can start back up (anecdotal, it happened to me, and also it is on my medical organization website). I think I am finally getting into menopause, but the tool isn't helpful for situations like mine. 
I also didn't see the sleep help tool or the other tools on the website. I would really be interested in that. "
8,142.105.11.32,Android,"Couldn't access the whole website. Clicked link and it took me directly to the survey, which were all questions based on the website! #useless"
24,24.250.15.34,Android,More about weight loss
25,47.26.135.230,Android,No
7,136.34.91.100,Android,"On the hot flash page at the bottom where you talk about how long it lasts for different races, non-Hispanic white are listed as 0.1 years, which really doesn't sound right.

I live this site! Finally I found a good explanation of what a hot flash is and how it works! What I thought was a heat intolerance is actually hot flashes. You guys explain everything really well, better than what I could find, do thank you so much!"
1,104.7.29.81,Android,Liked the select format
10,172.56.42.176,Android,I wouldn't change anything 
59,96.252.109.126,Chrome OS,"'Thanks for putting this together.  I think it will be very useful as new treatments are studied as a resource for women dealing with menopausal symptoms.
"
35,70.162.176.142,Macintosh,I would have liked to see some guidance on finding a doctor in my area. The other information in this site was very helpful. I plan on returning in the future. The treatment section was invaluable. I now know that one of the treatments I am using isn't really all that helpful & will seek out other options.
22,24.143.241.24,Macintosh,It would be helpful if the menoplan section was more detailed.  The suggestions for each symptom seemed very general.
29,67.188.101.116,Macintosh,"I think your website is probably really good for people who haven't learned anything yet about menopause and perimenopause.  For me having been in perimenopause for 9 years already, I didn't learn anything new, and I was hoping I would.  Maybe I should have expected I've already had 9 years to get informed.  I probably would have benefitted when I was first discovering what's happening to me.  The most important thing I have learned for managing hot flashes, and I had to figure this out on my own, is to eat a lot of ice chips."
43,71.255.32.18,Macintosh,"There were no helpful suggestions for managing symptoms.  If there are no truly helpful treatments for symptoms, just leave out a page that has a title that give us hope and then dashes them when we find out there's no way to treat them.  "
61,98.169.145.74,Windows,None
67,99.186.110.69,Windows,
64,98.27.129.144,Windows,"Great information. I saw an ad on Facebook and was curious about the site. I did not have any questions at this time. However, if I do, I will revisit this site. "
28,67.1.16.127,Windows,"could you include ""how to talk to your doctor""? I asked about treatments and the only thing she recommended was hormones. "
51,73.94.72.118,Windows,"The menoplan treatment area didn't make sense of how it is set up, took awhile to see the side items were actual links to more info. Don't understand why there are side slider toggles under ""may help"", what is the purpose? why not just a checkmark in a different color or a star symbol.  I also think the info provided in each link was not very interesting in format. I also think if you are providing info and tools for middle age persons, you should have font that is not in a grey scale format. It should be easier to read with better headings to attract the eye. It all seems very one note and easy to miss what is offered. I wans't aware of any dairies or other tools, never directed to those parts of the website.  I suggest a better web designer who understands the needs of middle age eyesight. "
38,70.18.238.174,Windows,"Maybe include Sections on ""What to do if...."" you have PCOD or were otherwise always irregular, if obese, if disabled, or infertile.  "
32,68.108.106.184,Windows,more knowledge about different ethnic backgrounds. I'm am of several mixed backgrounds so guessing a time frame for how long I might be expected to go through the change would be helpful :)
6,135.129.115.46,iOS,"Use a copy editor for content,"
53,75.187.42.179,iOS,"One of my concerns is how to explain to my husband what I'm going through, that it's natural, and not all in my head.  Maybe some conversation starters or an FAQ for friends and loved ones would be nice."
52,74.199.76.172,iOS,Hard to see which symptoms I'd selected for 'Create My Menoplan' using an iPad with iPadOS 14.8.  Perhaps increase contrast?
49,73.81.166.10,iOS,"You have loads of missing symptoms here that are standard across other sites for example acne ph problems causing BV and yeast infections the list goes on very disappointing, "
13,172.58.236.51,iOS,"Make the site more mobile friendly.  Also, instead of putting all the info in a table, make it so that you can explore each treatment."
58,76.9.91.238,iOS,Does marijuana help others because it helps me. I’d like to know 
34,68.47.20.170,iOS,"I found the site a little hard to navigate on my iPad, especially when trying to get back to a main page from a sub page. "
